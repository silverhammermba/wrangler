Wrangler is (going to be) a 2D top down game about wrangling cows and such. I'm
making it to teach myself C++11 and SFML 2.0, but also because I like playing
local coop games with my friends.

Eventually I plan to have 4 player local coop with controllers, and some fun
class-based teamwork-based gameplay. Until then, however, it's mostly a testing
bed for me to play around with things like animation and basic AI simulation.
